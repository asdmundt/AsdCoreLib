I represent an external file saved on the disk not in memory. I differ from ==MAExternalFileModel== as I don't deal with saving a file contents and generating a unique location, I only read files and don't write them. I expect to be passed a filepath to an already saved file.
I also store a url used to retrieve the file via a web server.
